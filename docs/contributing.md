# Contributing

## Submitting an issue or feature request

If you find an issue or have a feature request please open an issue at [Github RanCat Repo](https://github.com/mattjegan/rancat).

## Working on issues

If you think that you can fix an issue or implement a feature, please make sure that it isn't assigned to someone or if it is you may ask for an update.

Once an issue is complete, open a pull request so that your contribution can be reviewed. A TravisCI build and CodeCov report will run and be attached to your pull request. Your code must pass these checks.

## Helping others

At all times, please be polite with others who are working on issues. It may be their first ever patch and we want to foster a friendly and familiar open source environment.
